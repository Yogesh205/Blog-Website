        <h1>Impact of Caste-Based Reservations on Indian Society</h1>

        <p>Caste-based reservations in India have been a topic of intense debate since their introduction. Originally
            intended to uplift historically marginalized communities, particularly the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled
            Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), the system aimed to promote social equality and provide
            access to education, employment, and political representation. However, its impact on Indian society has
            been both positive and controversial.

            On the positive side, reservations have led to greater educational and employment opportunities for
            marginalized groups, enabling them to gain access to resources and positions of power that were once
            inaccessible. This has contributed to a reduction in social inequality and improved representation in
            government and public services.

            On the downside, critics argue that reservations perpetuate a sense of division and inequality, reinforcing
            caste-based identities rather than fostering unity. Some believe that the system has created resentment
            among non-reserved categories, leading to social tensions. Furthermore, the criteria for reservations are
            often based on caste rather than economic need, which means that wealthier individuals from reserved
            categories still benefit, leaving the truly disadvantaged behind.

            In conclusion, while caste-based reservations have played a significant role in addressing historical
            injustices, their continued implementation requires thoughtful reforms to ensure that they serve the
            intended purpose of creating a more equitable society.</p>
